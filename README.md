# Machine Learning classification model for a newly developed Fund- Hyper Climate Change Fund.
* Here, I have used Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to play a vital role in marketing optimization for the Sales Team of an Investment Bank while launching an Investment Fund product.
* Data sourced for this project is qualifies as Big Data hence it is efficient to use languages that help in such analysis.
* Data overview, Pre-processing and Machine learning modeling were all done using Python language.
* My analysis and activity helped build a predictive Machine Learning model to classify customers into the four categories of interest, and I believe that this model will help concerned Bank and in particular, each sales-person or the sales team to effectively target potential customers and improve the success of its marketing initiatives on this new fund product- Hyper Climate Change Fund.
